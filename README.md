# Starter - Angular 2 Vendor Dll

## Introduction

Webpack's CommonsChunkPlugin is a popular way to pack vendor, polyfills modules for nodejs, npm or Angular2 project. However webpack will go through the whole vendor, polyfills tree each time you recompile your project.

Webpack's Dll and DllReference plugins come in as a rescue. You can read the following article by Rob Knight

## Angular 2 Vendor Dll

This project aim to be a basic starting point to create Angular2 application using a vendor dll (vendor.js) containing the base Angular2 modules.

### Usage
Git clone
```
git clone https://github.com/J-Siu/Angular-2-Vendor-Dll.git
cd Angular-2-Vendor-Dll
```

Install global packages:
```
npm -g install webpack
npm -g install webpack-dev-middleware
npm -g install webpack-dev-server
```

Install local packages:
```
npm install
```

Create Dll
```
npm run vendor
```

Start Webpack dev server
```
npm start
```

Build
```
npm run build
```

### Files
##### webpack.config.vendor.js

`npm run vendor` will use webpack.config.ng2-dll.js to create vendor.js, and put it into src/public/js/.

>__To inculde more modules in vendor.js, modify `webpack.config.vendor.js`, `src/main.ts` and `package.json`.__

##### webpack.config.app.js 

`npm run build` will use webpack.config.app.js to transiple your Angular2 application.
